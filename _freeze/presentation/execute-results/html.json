How do mandatory seat belt laws impact traffic fatalities across different US states over time? This research question could involve analyzing the relationship between the presence and enforcement of seat belt laws and the number of fatalities per million traffic miles, considering variations between states and changes over the years.\n\n2.  What factors influence seat belt usage rates in the United States, and how do these factors interact with one another?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Shiny Application: Seatbelt Usage by State Overtime\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`<iframe data-deferred-src=\"app65a83afd1e5f7dcc34e37a10fb7d27c4/?w=&amp;__subapp__=1\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" class=\"shiny-frame shiny-frame-deferred\"></iframe>`{=html}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Shiny Application 2: Impact of Seat Belt Laws on Traffic Fatalities\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`<iframe data-deferred-src=\"app9d136e381dcd782df3ba8d322fabfce4/?w=&amp;__subapp__=1\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" class=\"shiny-frame shiny-frame-deferred\"></iframe>`{=html}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nThe data shows strong evidence that the implication as well as enforcement of seat belt laws has been an effective way to increase fatalities as well as seat belt use.\n\nWhat struck me was just how rapid seat belt use and enforcement grew over such a short time.\n\n# Thank you!\n",
