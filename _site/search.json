    "text": "Reason for Choosing this Dataset\nI am interested in transportation policy as well as how it intersects with public health/safety. My primary goal is to investigate the impact of mandatory seat belt laws on traffic safety outcomes, specifically focusing on traffic fatalities and seat belt usage rates. This research is motivated by the importance of understanding the effectiveness of policy interventions aimed at improving road safety and reducing the number of fatalities on US roads. By analyzing the USSeatBelts dataset, which contains balanced panel data for the years 1983–1997 from 50 US states plus the District of Columbia, we aim to provide empirical evidence on the relationship between seat belt laws and traffic safety outcomes."

This research question could involve analyzing the relationship between the presence and enforcement of seat belt laws and the number of fatalities per million traffic miles, considering variations between states and changes over the years.\nWhat factors influence seat belt usage rates in the United States, and how do these factors interact with one another?\n\nI hope to answer each of these questions through examining the correlation between seat belt usage rates and variables such as speed limits, minimum drinking age laws, income levels, and enforcement strategies, to gain insights into the multifaceted determinants of seat belt usage behavior. As well as for the first one looking at fatalities per million traffic miles and enforcement of seat belt laws.\nInteractive Visualization: An interactive and animated spatio-temporal visualization will be developed using tools such as ggplot2, plotly, and/or Shiny. The visualization will allow users to explore the relationship between seat belt laws, traffic fatalities, and seat belt usage rates over time and across different states."

The proposal will also include a plan for data collection, analysis, and reporting.\nRepository Structure: A GitHub repository will be set up for the project to facilitate collaboration and version control. The repository will include folders for documentation, data, code, and outputs.\nWeek 2 of Project (Week 10): Finalize Proposal and Peer Review\nFinalized Proposal: The project proposal will be finalized based on feedback. The proposal will be refined to ensure clarity, coherence, and alignment with project objectives.\nPeer Review: A peer review of project proposals from other teams will be conducted. Feedback will be provided on the clarity of objectives, feasibility of the research plan, and potential improvements.\nSubmission: The updated version of the project proposal will be submitted, incorporating any revisions based on peer feedback.\nFinal Project:\nWeek 3 of Project (Week 11): Project Development\nContinued Work: Work will continue on the project, focusing on data collection, cleaning, and analysis. Tasks will be managed according to the project plan.\nIncorporate Feedback: Feedback from the proposal phase will be incorporated into the project development process to ensure alignment with project goals and objectives.\nWeek 4 of Project (Week 12): Code Review\nPeer Code Review: A peer code review will be conducted to ensure code quality, readability, and reproducibility. Feedback will be used to improve the codebase.\nContinued Work: Work on the project will continue, refining analysis methods and interpreting results. Any necessary adjustments to the code will be made based on feedback.\nInteractive Visualization: Work on an interactive and animated spatio-temporal visualization will be developed using tools such as ggplot2, plotly, and/or Shiny.
